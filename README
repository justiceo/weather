Participants -
Justice Ogbonna - ejo36@drexel.edu
Pedro           - ps622@drexel (warmup class only)

There are three classes -
1) Main - control center of program, the conductor
2) Warmup - contains the warm up exercise, kinda pre-gaming
3) Wunderground - contains the application to get and print user location and then hourly forecast - the actual game

I'm using the library org.json to read and parse the json data into a JSONObject and JSONArray.
The URLs required to run the program has already been supplied, so the program takes no arguments
Hence - jdk-1.6 and above the java-json libraries are required to run the program

The extra-credit assignment is located in the web folder, in index.html
