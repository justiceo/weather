Program Description:
A program to get user location using auto ip and print the location,
then using their location information, the program would fetch and print the hourly weather forecast.
It also contains a warm up exercise and a web page for the extra credit (though not complete)
A README file contains more instructions of running the program

Development Environment:
The program is written in Java and include a build file - build.xml
It was written and compiled using IntelliJ IDE and jdk-1.6 on Windows OS.

Requirements:
jdk-1.6 or above
java json library

Running and Testing:
The program has been run successfully and tested on my windows machine.
To run this program in any other machine, the build.properties file must be modified to reflect the location of the jdk

The Lab:
Was a good way to familiarize myself with handling http requests in java
At some point, I was confused on what libraries to use, org.json, or org.json.simple or javax.json etc
The extra-credit gave me some headache though - spent an entire weekend on it

Comments:
Specific comments on which libraries to use
